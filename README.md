# `code-quality-maven-plugin`
> This project is an attempt to build a Maven plugin that can be used in you project to incorporate, declaratively (I.e. via Maven plugin configurations) other plugins that assist in ascertaining the quality of the code associated with that project.


The inspiration for this project is based on the [Maven Code Quality Pom](https://github.com/gregswindle/maven-code-quality-pom) project More to come later.
